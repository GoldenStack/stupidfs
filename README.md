### More files per file: hide files by storing them in the metadata of other files

---

Want to hide files inside other files? Want to make the most out of your
filesystem?

stupidfs stores files in the metadata of your files, allowing your filesystem to
hold more files per file.

This can be used as a stealthy way to hide data, or as a useless waste of time.

## How does it work?

stupidfs stores information in the 'last modified date' of files in the target
directory. The data is stored in the sub-second portion of the timestamp, so it
shouldn't have any visible effect when applied to a directory.

stupidfs is a good<sup>[citation needed]</sup> way to store files
inconspicuously, since it's quite hard to tell if a directory contains data
stored under stupidfs. in fact, the data itself is somewhat volatile: on my
machine, copy pasting the folder updates the last modified date, rendering
useless the idea of copying data from an existing drive for later use.

## Usage

First, run `cargo install stupidfs` or compile it from source.

To read, give stupidfs a directory and read the data from it.
```sh
stupidfs -o ./data
```

To write, give stupidfs a directory and pipe data into it.

```sh
echo "Hello, world!" | stupidfs -i ./data
```

Some notes:
- Output mode is enabled by default, so the `-o` is optional.
- A warning will be produced while writing if extra bytes are provided.
- One file is required for every two bytes of input.

stupidfs works on files with at least 128 nanosecond granularity. This includes
NTFS and ext4, and doesn't include FAT32 and ext4 with small inodes.


## Visibility
stupidfs stores data in the last few bits of the last modification date of each
file (only up to granularity of 128ns so that NTFS is supported). The first
few bits of the sub-second portion are not touched, meaning the actual change
in the timestamp is very small (up to 8.388ms).

## Accuracy
A filesystem supporting 128ns timestamp resolution does not necessarily mean the
kernel and hardware support timestamps of such a resolution.

If the hardware doesn't support this resolution or the kernel doesn't update
the system time that often, machine times might end up clustered around (or
exactly on) some greatest common divisor (e.g. microseconds). If this is the
case, it'll be pretty easy to figure out which files were artificially modified.

The fact that the last 128ns is untouched helps with this somewhat since
modifying dates at a lower resolution is compatible with all higher resolutions,
but this still shouldn't be relied on.

## Information
Technically, more than 2 bytes of information is used per file, as other file
metadata (e.g. filenames) is used to determine where a given file's bytes are
situated within the actual stored data. This isn't particularly important
though, since it's not correlated with actual file contents and can't be used to
reconstruct anythingâ€”it's just an interesting technicality that is probably
worth mentioning.
